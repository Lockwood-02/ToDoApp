# ToDoApp

This was one of my very first projects and something that I actually needed and used in my everyday life.

# Usage

Simply type in the task that you want to have saved for the day and hit save.
Each task is saved after input but after deleting a task make sure to save status so it is fully deleted.

If there are any issues with tasks not appearing simply click clear task as this will clean the local storage and should reset the app.
